The goal of Skimmer is to take in communication from multiple sources, email, github, "other," and learn what's important, then show on screen the most pressing notifcations.

Skimmer is my pet project, soup to nuts, using everything.  It's partially an idealistic demonstration of ability, partially a learning project, all to get the task done.

To setup, copy .env.example to .env and run setup.py.  Note, some variables will be required to deploy to kubernetes, but not for development.
